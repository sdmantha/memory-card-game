#Memory Card Game

##Description
---
Live demo link: 

This is a front-end web application developed as my first personal project while studying at General Assembly.

The matching game will just give you 20 tries to match two cards together.

##Technical requirements
---
### **My App Must:**

☐ Render a game in the browser**.

☐ Include win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining **dead and/or commented-out code** (code that will never be called).

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs, and variables (data) are named as nouns.

☐ **Be coded in a consistent** manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## **Necessary Deliverables**

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages** (covered next week).

- **A `README.md` file** with these sections:
    
    ☐ **<Your game's title>**: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.
    
    ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.
    
    ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
    
    ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.
    
    ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

## Technologies used
---
front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Future Features:
---
-Pop up you win with a ombre screen
-Have the cards shake when it's wrong
-Add music? or sounds when the card gets clicked

## MVP goals
---
-want a grid with columns and rows for each card
-make sure the funtions work for the shuffle, refresh, you win function, you lose function, how many lives you have left functions, make sure the card cannot get clicked on twice, and have the cards actually flip over and flip back when it's wrong.
